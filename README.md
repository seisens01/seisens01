- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @seisens01, AKA Sarah Eisenstein, PhD, from St. Louis, MO, USA. I earned a PhD in Neuroscience in 2008 from the University of Georgia, where I focused on pharmacological and behavioral research. Most recently, I held a 
Research Associate Professor position at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where I studied the neurobiology of human brain disease using neuroimaging techniques in collaboration with PhD and MD colleagues.  I was involved in study design, data 
collection, data processing, data analysis and statistics, and scientific writing on a daily basis. I am transitioning to data analytics because these tools allow for efficient derivation of key insights from large and unique datasets. 
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in securing a data analyst position related to health or medicine.  Special interests of mine include prevalence, prevention, and treatments for psychiatric and substance use disorders.   

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things data analytics! I am taking Data Analytics career pathway courses online at DataCamp and LinkedIn Learning. I have previous experience in R, SQL, Excel, Power BI and Tableau.
