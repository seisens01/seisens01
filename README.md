Hello! I am Sarah Eisenstein, PhD. I am seeking a data analyst position related to health or medicine.  Special interests of mine include prevalence, prevention, and treatments for psychiatric and substance use disorders. I believe knowing how to extract and analyze data 
from unique and large datasets is vital to making health discoveries that are relevant to the population at large. I earned a PhD in Neuroscience in 2008 from the University of Georgia, where I focused on pharmacological and behavioral research. Most recently, I held a 
Research Associate Professor position at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, where I studied the neurobiology of human brain disease using neuroimaging techniques in collaboration with PhD and MD colleagues.  I was involved in study design, data 
collection, data processing, data analysis, and scientific writing on a daily basis. I am excited to demonstrate my growing skillset in data analytics using this platform. Please reach out to me for any reason - I love discussing all things data!
